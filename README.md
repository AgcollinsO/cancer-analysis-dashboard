# 🧬 Cancer Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is an **interactive data analysis dashboard** built with **Streamlit** to explore cancer-related insights using a synthetic dataset. It aims to uncover trends and patterns in treatment cost, survival years, severity, and lifestyle impacts.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Trend Analysis:** Yearly trend of cancer cases
- **Treatment Costs:** Average cost by country, stage, and cancer type
- **Survival Analysis:** Comparison across cancer stages and age groups
- **Lifestyle Impact:** Correlation of smoking, alcohol use, and obesity with survival and severity
- **Severity Drivers:** Multivariate correlation to identify what contributes most to high severity
- **Healthcare Gap:** Identify regions with high severity but low treatment costs

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses Tested

1. Patients with advanced cancer stages have lower survival years.
2. Higher genetic risk scores are linked to higher severity scores.
3. Smoking and alcohol use negatively impact survival years.
4. Treatment costs are higher for more severe cases.
5. Gender affects treatment costs and survival.
